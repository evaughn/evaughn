### Professional Intro
> I'm a software engineer who is passionate about all things web. I look for any opportunity to expand my knowledge, and use technology to create innovative and engaging experiences across various platforms.

### Technologies
I'm pretty up-to-date with _most_ frontend technologies since I work on the client. On jobs, I've been React centered for the last *couple* of years (since 2018). Outside of work, I've poked at Angular, Vue, and Svelte just to get a taste of what's out there and in case a company works on any of them, or if a migration is happening. I lean more client-side UI/UX in my expertise, so I keep my ear to the ground on modern browser APIs and strategies. I'm the guy who will stay up at an ungodly hour researching new css strategies and pseudo-selectors (::has 💙) to try and get something done and then tell everyone about it for two weeks.

### What I'm doing
Brushing up my acumen and adding to my skill set. Right now I'm diving deep into AI and Typescript. This is the course I'm slated to take: [AI Hero](https://www.aihero.dev/)


#### What I'm working on
I'm going back to the basics since I've taken some time off for personal reasons. I've decided that my online portfolio (evaughn.net) needs an update. I haven't touched it since graduating college so it's the perfect guinea pig to fool around with some of the newer technologies out there. I've selected Remix (remix.run) to start as a base for the rewrite, and using Cloudflare for hosting, and exploring their suite of products.
