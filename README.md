### About me

### Recruiter tagline (LinkedIn filler)
> I'm a software engineer who is passionate about all things web. I look for any opportunity to expand my knowledge, and use technology to create innovative and engaging experiences across various platforms.

### Technologies
I'm pretty up-to-date with _most_ frontend technologies since I work on the client. On jobs, I've been React centered for the last *couple* of years (since 2018). Outside of work, I've poked at Angular, Vue, and Svelte just to get a taste of what's out there and in case a company works on any of them, or if a migration is happening. My bread-and-butter is UX, so I keep my ear to the ground on modern browser APIs and strategies. I'm the guy who will stay up at an ungodly hour researching new css strategies and pseudo-selectors (::has 💙) to try and get something done and then tell everyone about it for two weeks.

** insert something about semantic HTML and how I use it sometimes. _*#noteverythingisadiv*_ **

Outside of client-side scripting, I'm learning more about best practices about caching, network security, and storage. My early experience in these areas has been:

> (On Slack)
> *infra guy (or manager)*: This looks great! I've noticed a couple of issues with performance though. Can we optimize _lists everything I've considered and kicked the can on_
>
(me: screams internally)

me: Sure I can look into those things. I'll give you in update when each of those items are addressed

### What I'm doing
All good things come to an end, and in August 2024, I was let go from Persona. Perosal issues got in the way of my abilitt to show up on the job, so it was a necessary step.


#### What I'm working on
I'm going back to the basics since I've taken some time off for personal reasons. I've decided that my online portfolio (evaughn.net) needs an update. It's a bit......outdated. I haven't touched it since graduating college so it's the perfect guinea pig to fool around with some of the newer technologies out there. I've selected Remix (remix.run) to rewrite the whole damn thing. I'm also migrating it to Cloudflare to figure out network security and deploy management (personally tired of going to Infra folks whereever I work and saying "it's broken :halp:"
